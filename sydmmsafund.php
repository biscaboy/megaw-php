                        <p> Sydney was the Executive Producer and founder of The Megaw Theatre, Inc. and its educational wing, The Megaw Actors Studio. Under her watchful eye and Elaine's keen sense of direction, the Megaw Theatre flourished, as did the actors who came through their doors.
                        <br /><br />This year marks the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Megaw Theatre. It was a home away from home for so many artists, technicians, playwrights, directors and Sydney was always in the middle of each production and every class, seminar and workshop!
                        <br /><br />Syd’s life-work has inspired the establishment of a fund in her name, “The SYDNEY MAY MORRISON Sustaining Artists Fund”, whose primary purpose would be to provide The Megaw with operational, educational and artistic resources. Surely, there can be no better way than this to honor Sydney’s life and perpetuate her memory.
